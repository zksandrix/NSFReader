<h1>NSFReader</h1>

A new alternative to ScanEZ (Ytria) for HCL Notes. ****Works only with HCL Notes x64.***\
\
ScanEZ is a heavyweight solution with licensing. Without a license, only document reading is available.\
NSFReader is a simple, lightweight application created by an administrator for administrators. The main concept is convenience and speed!\
The application is in active development, but already has the basic features needed by administrators.\
****Currently, the application is not licensed and is freely available!***
## Installation
* Create the NSFReader.nsf database from the NSFReader.ntf template (ODS 55).
* Open the created NSFReader.nsf database and click the “Install NSFReader” button (lower left corner).
* In the security settings, set the flag: "Don't prompt for a password form other Notes-based programs".
* Restart the HCL Notes client.

After that, a new “NSFReader” panel will appear. There are only 2 buttons in this panel:
1. To open a single document.
2. To open all selected documents.
